WHAT'S THIS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code available in the /complex and /simple directories is POC that real
Ajax file upload is possible... but only in FF3 for the moment. The code had
initially accompanied a tutorial that is published at the moment at
http://igstan.blogspot.com/2009/01/pure-javascript-file-upload.html.

SOME DETAILS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The code in /simple concentrates on getting ONLY file data to the server, while
the code in /complex tries to serialize a full blown form with every type of
component that I could imagine and then send it to the server.

LICENSE
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
What you'll find in the source files is licensed under the new BSD license, so
feel free to use it for whatever you wish. I know of somebody that used it to
built a Mozilla Ubiquity command.

Enjoy it!
